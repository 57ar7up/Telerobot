A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/57ar7up/pen/LVWMNv.

 Taken from the Amazing Deus Ex Human Revolution video game. I set myself the challenge to re create it in CSS alone, and this is the outcome. I need to fix the transform origin on firefox and perhaps others, works fine in chrome
